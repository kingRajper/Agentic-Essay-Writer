## Project Overview

This project implements an agentic AI-powered essay writer that uses a state graph to track multiple threads and revisions. It provides a modular, extensible backend and a clean web interface built with Gradio to generate, continue, and manage essays and related content.

---

## Features

- Stateful graph-based agent architecture with support for multiple threads and revision tracking.
- Interactive Gradio UI with tabs for generating essays, planning, drafting, critiquing, and viewing state snapshots.
- Thread and step switching to revisit and modify previous states easily.
- State history management allowing rollback and copying of previous states.
- Modular functions for state retrieval, updating, and display.
- Flexible agent control with interruptible execution checkpoints.

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-essay-writer.git
cd agentic-essay-writer
````

Create and activate a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

---

## Usage

Run the app with:

```bash
python app.py
```

This launches a Gradio web UI accessible at `http://localhost:7860` (or as printed in the terminal).

From the interface, you can:

* Generate new essays based on a topic.
* Continue essay drafts.
* Manage multiple threads and revision states.
* Modify plans, drafts, critiques.
* View state snapshots and histories.

---

## Code Structure

* `essay_writer.py`: Core agent logic and graph-based state management.
* `gui.py`: Gradio interface definitions and callbacks.
* `main.py`: Main entry point to start the application.
* `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
* `README.md`: This file.

---

## How It Works

The system maintains a directed graph of states representing the agentâ€™s thought process, draft versions, and other metadata. Each state includes nodes with details such as revision number, thread ID, and content.

The Gradio frontend allows interacting with this graph:

* Viewing current state metadata (last node, next node, thread info).
* Switching threads and steps to load previous states.
* Modifying specific state keys like plan, draft, and critique.
* Generating new or continued essays via agent callbacks.

The modular design supports easy extension with new state keys and agent actions.
